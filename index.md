## Do You Need An Open Source Lifesaver?

Need help with open source?  Shane and Punderthingsâ„  Consulting are here to help!  

With nearly 20 years of experience with open source governance, community management, licensing, and branding policies, Punderthings can advise companies large and small on the best way to engage with open source.  As a long-time Member of the ASF I've helped Apache projects with everything from trademark infringements to building roadmaps to allow vendor employees to fairly work with Apache project communities.

## Open Source Trademark & Branding Expertise

As past VP, Brand Management for the Apache Software Foundation, I defined and implemented a [comprehensive branding strategy for the ASF](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/resources) and their 200+ Apache projects.  Trademarks are critical for open source projects - Shane can help you write your own policies or understand how best to respect open source brands anywhere.

## Apache Way Consulting - Effective Open Source Project Management

The ASF's Apache Way is a set of behaviors that help distributed teams manage their software projects more effectively.  As a regular speaker on Apache Way topics, I can help your team learn the behaviors that work for you, either inside your company or when engaging with independent open source projects.  I've also written a [complete Apache Way guide](http://theapacheway.com) and have [slides and video from my talks](http://shaneslides.com).

## Do You Need An Open Source Lifesaver?

Need help with open source?  Shane and Punderthingsâ„  Consulting are here to help!  

With nearly 20 years of experience with open source governance, community management, licensing, and branding policies, Punderthings can advise companies large and small on the best way to engage with open source.  As a long-time Member of the ASF I've helped Apache projects with everything from trademark infringements to building roadmaps to allow vendor employees to fairly work with Apache project communities.
